Machine Learning for Signal Processing

This repository contains a collections of machine learning algorithms implementations focused towards working to audio/signal processing and 
image processing problems.

The folders in the repository contain the repective sorce code files for each of the implementations along with the corresponding results and output files.

Note: All the source codes are built in python and do not use any pre-existing machine learning libraries.


Below are some of the alogithm implementations covered in this repository:
